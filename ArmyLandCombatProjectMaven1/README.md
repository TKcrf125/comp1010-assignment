# Army Land Combat

A warfare simulator, test your Tatics!!

## 1. Problem Statement

The aim of this project was to put a military spin on a turn based combat game while also hitting the projects assessment constraints and objectives. 

## 2. Project Structure

## 3. How to Run

1. go to the src file and open it 

2. go to ArmyLandCombat.java

3. run the code 

note: If you want the red to go away then click on each test and file but the game will run regardless. 
## 4. Features

* **Turn‑based combat**: pressing 1 for attack or 2 for defending in each round. 
* **Tutorial menu**: provides the three steps for playing the game 
* **Past‑Scores menu**: View scores in `scores.txt`
* **Action history**: Recursive log of unit actions via `TroopNode`
* **critical hits**: The chance that a unit will deal critical dammage acording to their crit chance
* **special Ability**: Each unit has a specific special ability  

## 5. Task Allocation

<!-- NOTE: Replace placeholders with actual team member names and details -->

| Team Member   | Contribution                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **\<Tom Kilburn>** |  |
| **\<Name 2>** |  |

## 6. UML Class Diagram

## 7. Method Analysis

### `GameEngine.playGame()`

<!-- NOTE: Write this in your own style, explaining logic and alternatives -->

* **Role**: Manages game loop—selects active units, prompts user actions, resolves combat outcomes, updates history, and persists scores.
* **Alternative**: Could use an event-driven observer pattern to decouple logic and UI.
* **Complexity**: Executes in O(n) time per turn; uses O(t) extra memory for action history of length t.

### `Troop.attack(Troop other)`

<!-- NOTE: Rephrase this damage calculation description -->

* **Implementation**: Calculates damage as `max(0, attackPower − other.defencePower)` and applies it to the target.
* **Alternative**: Introduce randomness or hit‑chance probabilities for more realism.
* **Performance**: Constant time and space (O(1)).

## 8. Scope Requirements

<!-- NOTE: Ensure this matches your code comments and evidence -->

1. **Object Containment**
   `TroopNode` directly references a `Troop` instance (not in a collection).

2. **ArrayList Usage**
   `CombatTeam` and `EnemyTeam` store their troops in `List<Troop>` backed by `ArrayList`.

3. **Recursive Data Structure**
   `TroopNode` forms a singly linked list; constructed in `GameEngine.buildTroopHistory()`.

4. **File I/O**
   Reads from and writes to `scores.txt` in the project root to save high scores.
