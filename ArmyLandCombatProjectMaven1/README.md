# Army Land Combat

A warfare simulator, test your Tatics!!

## 1. Problem Statement

The aim of this project was to put a military spin on a turn based combat game while also hitting the projects assessment constraints and objectives

```

## 3. How to Run

### Prerequisites

<!-- NOTE: Confirm version numbers and tooling are correct -->

* JDK 11+ installed
* Maven 3.x (if using the Maven build)

### Build & Test (Maven)

```bash
# Compile code and execute tests
mvn clean compile test

# Generate UML PDF (requires PlantUML & Graphviz)
plantuml -tpdf docs/ArmyLandCombat_UML.puml

# Launch the game
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="combat.ArmyLandCombat"
```

### Manual Build & Run (no Maven)

```bash
# Compile Java sources to bin directory
javac -d bin src/main/java/combat/**/*.java

# Run the game
java -cp bin combat.ArmyLandCombat
```

## 4. Features

<!-- NOTE: Rewrite feature descriptions to reflect your own phrasing -->

* **Turn‑based combat**: Choose Attack or Defend each round
* **Tutorial menu**: Step‑by‑step gameplay introduction
* **Past‑Scores menu**: View and persist scores in `scores.txt`
* **Action history**: Recursive log of unit actions via `TroopNode`
* *(Optional extras: e.g., critical hits, unit‑specific abilities)*

## 5. Task Allocation

<!-- NOTE: Replace placeholders with actual team member names and details -->

| Team Member   | Contribution                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **\<Name 1>** | Implemented GameEngine, file I/O, recursive history          |
| **\<Name 2>** | Developed domain model classes (`Troop`, `CombatTeam`, etc.) |
| **\<Name 3>** | Created ConsoleUI, InputUtil, UI tests                       |
| **\<Name 4>** | Setup Maven, authored README, UML diagram, method analysis   |

## 6. UML Class Diagram

<!-- NOTE: Replace placeholder with your generated PDF diagram -->

![Class Diagram](docs/ArmyLandCombat_UML.pdf)

## 7. Method Analysis

### `GameEngine.playGame()`

<!-- NOTE: Write this in your own style, explaining logic and alternatives -->

* **Role**: Manages game loop—selects active units, prompts user actions, resolves combat outcomes, updates history, and persists scores.
* **Alternative**: Could use an event-driven observer pattern to decouple logic and UI.
* **Complexity**: Executes in O(n) time per turn; uses O(t) extra memory for action history of length t.

### `Troop.attack(Troop other)`

<!-- NOTE: Rephrase this damage calculation description -->

* **Implementation**: Calculates damage as `max(0, attackPower − other.defencePower)` and applies it to the target.
* **Alternative**: Introduce randomness or hit‑chance probabilities for more realism.
* **Performance**: Constant time and space (O(1)).

## 8. Scope Requirements

<!-- NOTE: Ensure this matches your code comments and evidence -->

1. **Object Containment**
   `TroopNode` directly references a `Troop` instance (not in a collection).

2. **ArrayList Usage**
   `CombatTeam` and `EnemyTeam` store their troops in `List<Troop>` backed by `ArrayList`.

3. **Recursive Data Structure**
   `TroopNode` forms a singly linked list; constructed in `GameEngine.buildTroopHistory()`.

4. **File I/O**
   Reads from and writes to `scores.txt` in the project root to save high scores.
