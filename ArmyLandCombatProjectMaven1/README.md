# Army Land Combat

A warfare simulator, test your Tatics!!

## 1. Problem Statement

The aim of this project was to put a military spin on a turn based combat game while also hitting the projects assessment constraints and objectives. 

## 2. Project Structure

<!-- NOTE: Adapt directory names or descriptions if you reorganize folders locally -->

## 3. How to Run

1. go to the src file and open it 

2. go to ArmyLandCombat.java

3. run the code 

note: If you want the red to go away then click on each test and file but the game will run regardless. 
## 4. Features

* **Turn‑based combat**: pressing 1 for attack or 2 for defending in each round. 
* **Tutorial menu**: provides the three steps for playing the game.
* **Past‑Scores menu**: View scores in `scores.txt`.
* **Action history**: Recursive log of unit actions via `TroopNode`.
* **critical hits**: The chance that a unit will deal critical dammage acording to their crit chance.
* **special Ability**: Each unit has a specific special ability all special abilities have a cooldown. 

## 5. Task Allocation

| Team Member   | Contribution                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **\<Tom Kilburn>** |  Establish turn-based sequence (attack/defend choices each round)
. Specify win/loss conditions (all enemy units defeated vs. player squad wiped out)
. Design units & stats
. Choose unit types (Infantry, Armored Platoon, Artillery, etc.)
. Set health, attackPower, defencePower for each
. Balance strengths/weaknesses so no one unit dominates
. Craft the tutorial flow
. Write the step-by-step “Tutorial” menu content
. Decide what tips/hints to show and in what order
. Lay out the UI
. write menu structure and prompts
. write the scoring system
. Choose formula for “score” (e.g. sum of remaining health + stats)
. Decide how and when to record scores to scores.txt
. Create the recursive history feature
. Decide what events to record in the TroopNode chain (e.g. each action taken)
. Determine how deep/value of history for post-game analysis
. design and implement files format
. Define the plain-text format of scores.txt (one number per line)
. Make the UML class diagram
. Map game concepts (engine, UI, domain) to classes & relationships
. Choose packages and package names
. Develop method-analysis write-up
. creating the game loop 
. Work with the Test Designer to ensure those scenarios are covered |
| **\<Asmi Jambhale>** | • Role: Editor and Test Designer 
Tasks: 
• Refactor and reorganise code into packages (engine, ui, domain, util)
• Standardise indentation (4-spaces) and brace style across all .java files
• Rename variables and methods for clarity 
• Extract helper methods to improve delegation 
• Add and update Javadoc on every public class and method
• Ensure all imports are correct 
• Verify Maven pom.xml is configured properly 
• Merge all branches and resolve conflicts, commit final code structure
Domain classes 
Engine features (GameEngine.buildTroopHistory(), file I/O, win/lose paths)
• Write and review test cases for normal and out of pocket scenarios (empty lists, invalid input loops, all-dead teams)
• Implement test classes: EnemyTeamTest, TroopNodeTest, InputUtilTest, ConsoleUITest, GameEngineTest
• Configure Maven Surefire plugin to run tests automatically with mvn test
• Ensure tests pass offline
• Measure basic coverage and add any missing critical paths
• Document in README the existence of unit tests and how to run them |

## 7. Method Analysis

### `GameEngine.playGame()`

<!-- NOTE: Write this in your own style, explaining logic and alternatives -->

* **Role**: Manages game loop—selects active units, prompts user actions, resolves combat outcomes, updates history, and persists scores.
* **Alternative**: Could use an event-driven observer pattern to decouple logic and UI.
* **Complexity**: Executes in O(n) time per turn; uses O(t) extra memory for action history of length t.

### `Troop.attack(Troop other)`

<!-- NOTE: Rephrase this damage calculation description -->

* **Implementation**: Calculates damage as `max(0, attackPower − other.defencePower)` and applies it to the target.
* **Alternative**: Introduce randomness or hit‑chance probabilities for more realism.
* **Performance**: Constant time and space (O(1)).

## 8. Scope Requirements

<!-- NOTE: Ensure this matches your code comments and evidence -->

1. **Object Containment**
   `TroopNode` directly references a `Troop` instance (not in a collection).

2. **ArrayList Usage**
   `CombatTeam` and `EnemyTeam` store their troops in `List<Troop>` backed by `ArrayList`.

3. **Recursive Data Structure**
   `TroopNode` forms a singly linked list; constructed in `GameEngine.buildTroopHistory()`.

4. **File I/O**
   Reads from and writes to `scores.txt` in the project root to save high scores.
