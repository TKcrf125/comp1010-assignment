TOPIC 1: Masters of MQ: Turn-Based RPG Combat
(File name: majorAssignmentTopic1.zip)
A typical turn-based RPG involves two teams, each consisting of one or more characters,
fighting until one team has had all their characters reach 0 "health points". On their turn,
characters can perform two or more actions, such as attacking or defending. Often,
characters cannot take actions if they do not have any health points left.
In most text-based games (like this one), information on the outcome of an action is
delivered to the player via an easy-to-read, sometimes exciting string, such as "Aang
attacked Deadpool! Deadpool took 5 points of damage!"
A character generally has a few base "stats" such as strength, intelligence and defence
that dictate the outcome of an action. For instance, if character A attacks character B,
compare A's strength against B's defence. “Dice rolls” or other randomness is often
factored into an outcome to give the game some unpredictability and excitement. E.g., a
number between 0-5 is added to attack damage, or a dice roll determines if the attack
hits or not.
The order in which characters take turns may be team-by-team, back-and-forth, or
determined using some sort of “initiative” stat and dice roll.
Characters themselves often have other elements that impact their stats or the potential
outcome of an action. This may include equipment (armour, particular weapons, or
enchanted rings), attributes based on race (Orc, Elf, Alien, Robot) and class (Rogue,
Engineer, Barbarian, Mage), and even other “stat effects” (Poisoned, Wounded).
